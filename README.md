# UART Implementation on FPGA

This repository contains the implementation of a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) module on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. The project was completed as part of the EN2111 - Electronic Circuit Design module at the Department of Electronic & Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to design, implement, and verify a UART module on an FPGA, providing reliable asynchronous serial communication.

## üîë Key Features

- üì° UART protocol implementation
- üíª FPGA-based design and verification
- üî¨ Comprehensive testbench development
- üõ†Ô∏è RTL code for transmitter and receiver
- üìä ModelSim simulation and timing diagram analysis

## Project Overview

The project is divided into four distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Research and Design Selection
- Research the UART protocol, including data framing, synchronization, and baud rate settings.
- Explore existing Verilog implementations of UART transceivers.
- Review and select a suitable implementation that meets the specified requirements.

### Phase 2: Testbench Development
- Understand the UART module's input and output signals.
- Write a Verilog testbench to simulate the UART environment.
- Test the UART module with various data patterns, baud rates, and edge cases.
- Utilize ModelSim for simulation and debugging.

### Phase 3: FPGA Implementation
- Set up the FPGA development environment (Intel Quartus).
- Develop additional RTL for driving the 7-segment displays.
- Simulate and verify the UART and 7-segment drive circuit.
- Integrate the UART RTL with FPGA specifics, such as GPIO pin assignments and clock frequency matching.
- Synthesize the design, perform place and route, and download the bitstream to the FPGA board.

### Phase 4: Signal Analysis
- Set up an oscilloscope and connect probes to the UART TX and RX lines.
- Configure the oscilloscope for appropriate time and voltage settings.
- Transmit data from the FPGA and observe the waveform corresponding to the UART protocol.
- Analyze the signal for correct start bit, data bits, parity bit, stop bit, and potential signal integrity issues.
